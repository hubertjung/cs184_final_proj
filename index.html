<h2 align="left">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p>
Goals:
We want to be able to simulate realistic fluid particles that take into account properties such as incompressibility, vorticity, and viscosity. Incompressible means that the density of water is constant. We use vorticity confinement to add rotational energy to the particles. We also want the particles to have viscosity, or thickness. By the end of the project we should be able to simulate scenes such as opening a floodgate of water, and dropping an object into a container of water. 

We also hope to add some more realism to the scene by rendering the particles to look like an actual fluid. If possible, we would like to additionally implement buoyancy physics. Another cool extension would be interactive surface disturbances such as creating ripples in a surface of water.
